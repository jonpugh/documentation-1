##Platform Improvements
**PHP 5.5 opcache revalidate-freq Value is Now Set to Zero**   
Previously, for sites on PHP 5.5 (WordPress sites default, Drupal sites can [upgrade now](https://pantheon.io/docs/articles/sites/settings/toggling-between-php-versions/)), code changes were only refreshed every 60 seconds, regardless of the environment. Now, Dev/Multidev environments on 5.5 will immediately see code changes, and Test/Live now refresh every 2 seconds.

**PHP Default Arg Separator**    
The arg separator is used in PHP generated URLs to separate arguments. For PHP 5.5, we changed the default PHP arg separator from `&amp;` to `&`. To use the old arg separator, modify [settings.php](https://pantheon.io/docs/articles/drupal/configuring-settings-php/#troubleshooting) or [wp-config.php](https://pantheon.io/docs/articles/wordpress/configuring-wp-config-php/#troubleshooting).

**Terminus CLI Version 0.7.1**    
Get the [latest version](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/releases/). We’re steaming ahead to a 1.0 release and can use your help over on Github. 

**Saint Mode Saves your Images**     
If there’s an outage or hardware issue with the Pantheon File System, “Saint Mode” now kicks in to serve your images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

**nginx.conf Update for Photon**  
If you use [Jetpack’s Photon](http://jetpack.me/support/photon) tool, the Photon user agent can now access files on locked sites.
