For two weeks, you'll receive a trial of New Relic's Pro plan for the site. New relic monitoring is automatically enabled for all application servers added to the site, including Multidev environments.

## Remove Multidev Environments in New Relic
After deleting a Multidev environment from your site, you'll need to manually [remove them in New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/remove-applications-servers).  

1. From your Dashboard, select the **New Relic** tab, and **Open New Relic**.  
2. From the New Relic menu bar, select **APM** > **Applications**.  
3. Wait until the color-coded health status to turn gray, then select the app's gear icon.
4. Select **Delete app**, and click the confirmation button.
