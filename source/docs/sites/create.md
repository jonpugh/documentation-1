## Free Sites
Free sites are useful for trying out the Pantheon platform, creating sandboxes for development, or for starting a new client project. We allocate two free sandbox sites for all user accounts. When one of your sites converts to a paid plan, you can start another sandbox site. If you need additional development sites, contact us and we'll be happy to work with you.
## Your Pantheon Account
Your account is your own individual account, and every account can manage multiple projects (or sites) at a time. Pantheon doesn't recommend sharing your account with other people. If you're collaborating on a project or handing over ownership to a client, use our  team management and ownership transfer tools.
