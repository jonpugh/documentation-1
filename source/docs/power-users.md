If you are an active developer on the Pantheon platform, you may benefit from joining our [Power Users group](https://groups.google.com/a/pantheon.io/forum/#!forum/power-users). This is a community for people who are actively making use of Pantheon for many sites. 

## Power User Topics

This is not a support resource, but it is a source of great ideas, inspirations, and insights. Examples of recent conversation threads:

- Accessing the Apache Solr search index from an AngularJS app
- Decoupled website architecture (aka "headless Drupal")
- Using symlinks for legacy file locations
- Controlling user access to environments
- Terminus tricks for Continuous Integration

The Power Users community is an excellent way to bounce ideas off other expert developers. It's also the best way to get early access to beta features and other "Pantheon insider" info.

## Joining the Group

If you have a Google account you can join via the [group page](https://groups.google.com/a/pantheon.io/forum/#!forum/power-users), which also allows you to browse and interact via the web.
