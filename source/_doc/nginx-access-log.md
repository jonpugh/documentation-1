Pantheon uses nginx web servers for optimal performance. Log files record the web server events and activities and can help you identify potential issues and gather information about users.

[GoAccess](http://goaccess.io/) is a free, open source utility that creates on the fly server reports by parsing the `nginx-access.log` file. Use it to quickly identify the most used browsers and operating systems, or to debug failed requestsâ€”all from the command line.

## Before You Begin

Be sure that you have:

- [A local copy of the target site environment's `nginx-access.log` file](/docs/logs)
- [GoAccess](http://goaccess.io/) installed:
 - **Mac OS X**: Install via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
 - **Windows**: Use [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/install.html)

## Edit GoAccess Configuration

To parse the Pantheon `nginx-access.log` file with GoAccess, you'll need to specify the unique log formats.

Add the following lines to the `goaccess.conf` file, located in either `/etc/`, `/usr/etc/` or `/usr/local/etc/` depending on your installation method:

```
time_format %H:%M:%S %z
date_format %d/%b/%Y
log_format %^ %^ %^ [%d:%t]  "%r" %s %b "%R" "%u" %T "%h"
```
## Generate Report
Run the following command, which will parse the log file and open a dashboard in your terminal so you can view the results:
```
goaccess -f nginx-access.log
```
If you would like to generate an HTML report, execute the following commands:
```
goaccess -f nginx-access.log > report.html
open report.html
```
